## If you need to pull images from a private Docker image repository, pass in the name
## of a Kubernetes Secret that contains the needed secret. For more details, see:
## Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/

imagePullSecrets: []
# - name: "image-pull-secret"

## For small or experimental deployments of the Kubernetes runner, 1 replica will suffice.
## For production cases, 2-3 are recommended. This does not grant additional parallelism,
## but does ensure that upgrades, config changes, and disruptions are handled more gracefully.
