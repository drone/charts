## If you need to pull images from a private Docker image repository, pass in the name
## of a Kubernetes Secret that contains the needed secret. For more details, see:

# - name: "image-pull-secret"

## For small or experimental deployments of the Kubernetes runner, 1 replica will suffice.
## For production cases, 2-3 are recommended. This does not grant additional parallelism,
## but does ensure that upgrades, config changes, and disruptions are handled more gracefully.
replicaCount: 1

## When the runner receives a SIGTERM/SIGINT (config update, upgrade, etc), it will wait until
## all jobs that particular pod has spawned complete. It is for this reason that you'll want
## to make sure that this value is longer than your longest job.
